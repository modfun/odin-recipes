            <li>½ (28 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>½ onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried basil (Optional)</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook 
                and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned 
                and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard 
                grease. Add spaghetti sauce, tomatoes, onion, garlic
                , basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook over low 
                heat until sauce is hot, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water 
                and bring to a rolling boil. Cook mafalda noodles at 
                a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 
                minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir 
                until completely coated. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source 
                and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
            <li>Place skillet under the hot broil and cook until cheese 
                is golden and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
